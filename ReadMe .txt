You need 1.8.0 JRE to run this software.If you have that,

	1. Go to "git repo" folder.
	2. Then open the SQL folder.
	3. Import the comshop.sql file to comshop schema on MySQL 
(or direct import the comshop_withSchema.sql to MySQL then you do not 
have to create a schema unless the sql versions are matching )
	4. Now double click on the CommunicationShop.exe in "git repo" folder.
